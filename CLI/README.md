# Micrio Command Line tool

`micrio` is a command line tool for processing and uploading images directly from your computer to the [Micrio Dashboard](https://micr.io).

## Quick Start

*IMPORTANT*: Make sure your system is using node version `20.13.1`. Use `nvm` to switch if necessary.

1. Install the Micrio tool as a global binary

	```bash
	npm i -g @micrio/cli
	```

2. Log in to your Micrio account and follow the steps you are prompted with

	```bash
	micrio login
	```

3. Open the Micrio dashboard and navigate to the folder you want to place your images,
	ie. https://dash.micr.io/my-group/my-project

	```bash
	micrio upload my-image.jpg -d https://dash.micr.io/my-group/my-project
	```

4.  Now reload your dashboard page, and the image should be there!

For more detailed information about configuration, refer to the [documentation](https://doc.micr.io/dashboard/v3/cli-tool.html).

## Commands

#### `micrio login`

Connect the `micrio` executable to your logged in Micrio account

#### `micrio logout`

Remove your Micrio account credentials

#### `micrio upload <images> --destination <url> --format <webp|jpg> --type <2d|360|omni>`

Process and upload one or several images (wildcards are supported) to the specified destination URL, which is the deeplink of the target folder in your Micrio Dashboard.

By default, it processes images to `webp` tiles, but you can change that to `jpg` using the `--format` option.

You can also process it as an equirectangular 360ยบ image, using `--type=360`. For selected accounts, Omni (360ยบ object photography) is also available. Check out [our website](https://micr.io/) for more information.

For more commands and options, refer to the [documentation](https://doc.micr.io/dashboard/v3/cli-tool.html) or run `micrio help [command]`.
